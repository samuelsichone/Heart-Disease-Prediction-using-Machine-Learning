# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate. Using machine learning, the system analyzes patient data to help assist in early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases — one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
